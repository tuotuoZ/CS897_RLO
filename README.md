# CS897_RLO How does BitCoin work?


## Intro
A fun introduction to BitCoin! Students in CS597N have learned lots of Network Security topics over the semester. This course not only taught them BitCoin technology but also reviewed some important concepts students have already learned during the summer. Students were asked to design a ledger banking system at the beginning of the class. The initial design of the ledger system was rudimentary.  As the class progressed, students gradually integrated digital signature and hash functions into the ledger system. In the end, students produced a design of a banking system called UMassCoin that was similar to BitCoin. Then, the students participate a psuedo-mining activity where each student played as a GPU and calculated hash values for given transactions. Whoever was the fastest on calculating the hash value got a reward UMassCoin for each block, which promoted students' engagement with the activity. When students finished exercise, they experienced the benefits of using the Digital Signature and hash function through a real-life application.
